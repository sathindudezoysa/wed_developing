			An unearthed cache of century-old photographs of a South African choir that had performed in Victorian Britain inspired a choreographer to reimagine what they went through as they toured the country.

			Gregory Maqoma remembers going into his favourite space in the Apartheid Museum in South Africa's main city, Johannesburg, five years ago.

			It is a room in the round - with only one way in and out and gently curving walls that, he says, fills him with a sense of serenity and privacy.

			The South African choreographer was drawn to the centre of the room by the sound of music and singing voices.
