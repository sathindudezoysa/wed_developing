	<td>The UN Secretary General has urged M23 rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo to respect a ceasefire agreement set to come into effect on Tuesday.
	Antonio Guterres has welcomed regional and international efforts led by the Angolan president and the African Union to try to stop a conflict that has displaced hundreds of thousands already.

Hours before the ceasefire brokered by Angola takes effect, heavy fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 group has continued in North Kivu province.

The UN Secretary General has condemned all violence against civilians and urged all armed groups to lay down their weapons and disarm unconditionally.

Mr Guterres has asked the M23 to honour a pledge to cease hostilities to facilitate full and effective withdrawal from areas it has occupied, some near Goma, the biggest city in the east of the country.

The ongoing conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands in the past year and led to accusations that Rwanda is funding the rebels, which Kigali denies.</td>

	<td>A helicopter pilot did not recall hearing a radio call from another helicopter shortly before a deadly mid-air collision in Australia, a report has suggested.

The interim accident report also said the pilots may not have been able to see each other.

A British couple were among four people killed when the two helicopters collided off the Gold Coast in January.

One helicopter crashed, while the other managed to land with heavy damage.

The helicopters were being used for short sightseeing trips by Sea World Helicopters. One was coming in to land, while the other had just taken off.

"The report details the calls made by the pilot of the returning helicopter and as they tracked southâ€¦ that they saw passengers boarding the second helicopter as it was preparing to depart," Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said.</td>

	<td>It was in early September last year, during Ukraine's grinding counter-offensive in the southern Kherson region, that Illya Pylypenko's war ended abruptly.

The soldier's tank drove over a mine as it headed into combat. When the 30-year-old regained consciousness, he was surrounded by fire.

"You are not thinking about what you need to do," he says. "You do it because you want to live."

Illya survived because he was able to crawl out and be evacuated by his comrades. He has since had several operations and skin transplants for his burns, and his right leg had to be amputated below the knee.

Six months later, he still contemplates his life-changing injuries.

"I had both disappointments and hope," he says. "The hardest stage of my treatment is behind me. I dream about walking soon."</td>

	<td>Dozens of people have fallen sick in coastal villages in the Philippines after a major oil spill from a sunken tanker.

The MT Princess Empress was carrying 800,000 litres of industrial fuel oil when it sank off the coast of the Oriental Mindoro province last week.

That oil has since reached the shores of several nearby fishing villages, coating beaches in black sludge.

Residents have reported experiencing cramps, vomiting and dizziness.

Clean-up workers deployed to the affected village of Pola have also reported feeling ill, local media reported.

Breathing fuel oil vapours can cause symptoms such as nausea and headaches, while skin contact may cause itchiness and blisters.</td>

	<td>Eswatini Prime Minister Cleopas Dlamini said in Taipei on Monday that his country remains committed to diplomatic relations with Taiwan and is opposed to "any sort of bullying or aggression" against Taiwan.

"The people of Taiwan should be governed within Taiwan by a government they elect themselves in fair and free elections, with no external pressure," Mr Dlamini said during a meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen.

Mr Dlamini also thanked the Taiwan government for its decades-long support of Eswatini.

Eswatini is the only African state and one of 14 countries worldwide that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan - which China regards as a breakaway province.

Taiwan and Eswatini are set to celebrate 55 years of diplomatic ties in September..</td>
